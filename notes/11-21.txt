-d 2800 -f 280

g1: conveyers of non-dancers for every third row of dancers. 10 intervals of dancing before switching.

g2: large scale coordinated movement to swap dancers on stage with dancers waiting in a crowd

David: more computationally demanding to coordinate a large movement without claustrophobia
